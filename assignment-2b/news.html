    <h2>The New Dance Moves of Rihanna (EXPLORED)</h2>
    <p>
      Yesterday, the singer posted a brand-new video to Instagram in which she
      can be seen dancing while wearing a gray oversized hoodie and matching
      pants. She accessorizes the ensemble with a silver chain necklace, wears
      her hair down in a silky blowout, and opts for a bronze beauty look.
      <br />
      A musical remix of her speaking is playing as she dances around in the
      laid-back outfit by Savage x Fenty. "I hate you if your hands are on a
      phone texting. If you're taking photos of me, I just want to see you on
      your phone "she claims.

      The 10-year anniversary gala for L.A. Dance Project is brought to life by
      dance
    </h2>
    <p>
      On October 29, L.A. hosted a banquet to celebrate their tenth anniversary
      at the Pritzker home in Beverly Hills. Dance Project honored a decade of
      dance in front of the audience that sustained its craft. Dancers strolled
      through the estate, greeting guests with outstretched arms before
      launching into a routine that kissed the ground in every area of the
      property. The audience was enthralled by the show both inside and outside
      the house as they watched, frequently giggling along with the dancers.
      <br />
      The group just debuted "Be Here Now," a new piece choreographed by
      Benjamin Millepied, co-artistic director and co-founder of LADP, alongside
      Gisèle Vienne's "Crowd" on Wednesday and Thursday at LADP's downtown Los
      Angeles location.
